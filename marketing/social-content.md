# Social Content Library: AI Visibility Index

## LinkedIn Content

### Post 1: Stat-driven Hook
```
ðŸ“Š 73% of B2B buyers now use AI for research before making purchases.

But here's what's shocking: Most brands have ZERO visibility into what ChatGPT, Gemini, and Perplexity say about them.

Your competitors could be dominating AI search results while you're invisible.

3 signs you need AI search optimization:
â€¢ Sales team hearing "AI recommended competitor X"
â€¢ Declining organic lead quality  
â€¢ Competitors mentioned in AI responses, you're not

The solution? Start tracking your AI visibility score.

Comment "AI AUDIT" and I'll send you a free report showing exactly what AI platforms say about your brand vs competitors.

### Post 2: Case Study Format
```
ðŸš€ How a SaaS company increased qualified leads by 300% with AI search optimization:

THE PROBLEM:
â€¢ ChatGPT never mentioned them in software recommendations
â€¢ Competitors dominated AI responses in their category
â€¢ Sales team struggling with "cold" leads

THE STRATEGY:
âœ… Tracked AI visibility across 500+ industry prompts daily
âœ… Identified content gaps AI platforms needed
âœ… Optimized existing content for AI discoverability
âœ… Monitored competitive positioning in real-time

THE RESULTS (60 days):
â€¢ 300% increase in AI-sourced leads
â€¢ #1 brand mentioned in ChatGPT responses for their category  
â€¢ 45% shorter sales cycles (leads came pre-educated)

The shift to AI search is happening NOW.

Are you tracking what AI says about your brand?

### Post 3: Contrarian Take
```
ðŸ”¥ Hot take: SEO is dying. AI search is the future.

While you're optimizing for Google's 10 blue links, your customers are getting instant answers from ChatGPT.

The data doesn't lie:
â€¢ 67% of professionals use AI for work research
â€¢ AI responses have ZERO ads, just pure recommendations
â€¢ Traditional SEO tactics don't work for AI platforms

Winners in 2024 will be brands that:
âž¤ Monitor AI platform mentions daily
âž¤ Optimize content for AI discoverability  
âž¤ Track competitive AI positioning
âž¤ Build authority AI platforms trust

The question isn't IF AI will replace search.

It's WHETHER you'll be visible when it does.

What's your AI search strategy?
