#### Maker Comment
```
Hey Product Hunt! üëã

As a former marketing exec, I watched helplessly as our carefully crafted SEO strategy became less effective each month. Then I noticed something: our sales team kept hearing "ChatGPT recommended your competitor."

That's when it hit me - the future of search isn't 10 blue links. It's AI platforms giving instant, authoritative recommendations.

But here's the problem: 99% of brands have no idea what AI platforms say about them.

That's why I built Llumos. We're the first platform dedicated to AI search optimization for B2B brands.

In 6 months, we've helped 500+ companies:
‚Ä¢ Increase AI-sourced leads by 300%
‚Ä¢ Reduce customer acquisition costs by 40%
‚Ä¢ Shorten sales cycles by 45%

The shift to AI search is happening NOW. The brands that adapt first will dominate for years.

Questions? I'll be here all day answering comments!

üöÄ Today's the day! We're live on Product Hunt with Llumos.

6 months ago, I realized that traditional SEO was becoming less effective as more people turned to AI for research.

The problem? Most brands have no idea what ChatGPT, Gemini, and Perplexity say about them vs competitors.

That's why we built Llumos - the first AI search optimization platform for B2B brands.

We'd love your support: [Product Hunt link]

What questions do you have about optimizing for AI search?

üßµ We're LIVE on @ProductHunt! 

Here's the story behind Llumos and why AI search optimization matters:

1/ Six months ago, our sales team kept hearing: "ChatGPT recommended your competitor"

2/ We realized 73% of B2B buyers now use AI for research, but traditional SEO doesn't work for AI platforms

3/ Most brands are completely invisible in AI search results

4/ That's a massive opportunity for early movers

5/ So we built Llumos - track and optimize your brand's visibility across ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, and Google AI Overviews

6/ In 6 months, we've helped 500+ brands increase AI-sourced leads by 300%

7/ The shift to AI search is happening NOW. Support us: [PH link]
