# TODO: Optimization Implementation Tasks

## Branch: maint/opt-ui-01

This branch contains infrastructure for optimization features. All features are behind flags (default OFF) and ready for implementation.

### âœ… Completed Infrastructure
- Feature flags configuration (`src/config/featureFlags.ts`)
- Test scaffolding for critical flows (all tests skipped until implementation)
- Structured logging system for observability
- Integration test framework for optimization features

### ðŸ”„ Next Implementation Phase

#### 1. Bulk Query Optimization (FEATURE_BULK_QUERIES)
**Priority: HIGH - Addresses N+1 query issues**
- [ ] Implement batch query functions in `src/lib/data/bulk-fetcher.ts`
- [ ] Update `getUnifiedDashboardData` to use bulk queries when flag enabled
- [ ] Add bulk competitor fetching for `PromptCompetitors` component
- [ ] Enable tests in `src/__tests__/critical-flows/` when implementation ready

#### 2. Response Caching (FEATURE_RESPONSE_CACHE)
**Priority: HIGH - Major performance impact**
- [ ] Implement cache layer in `src/lib/cache/response-cache.ts`
- [ ] Add TTL-based caching for dashboard data
- [ ] Cache provider responses with appropriate invalidation
- [ ] Add cache performance metrics

#### 3. Strict Competitor Detection (FEATURE_STRICT_COMPETITOR_DETECT)
**Priority: MEDIUM - Quality improvement**
- [ ] Integrate existing `strict-detector.ts` with feature flag
- [ ] Update edge functions to use strict detection when enabled
- [ ] Add A/B testing between standard and strict detection
- [ ] Measure quality improvements

#### 4. Light UI Mode (FEATURE_LIGHT_UI)
**Priority: MEDIUM - Render performance**
- [ ] Create lightweight versions of heavy components
- [ ] Implement virtual scrolling for large lists
- [ ] Add skeleton loading states
- [ ] Optimize re-render patterns

#### 5. Accessibility Features (FEATURE_A11Y)
**Priority: LOW - Compliance**
- [ ] Add comprehensive ARIA labels
- [ ] Implement keyboard navigation
- [ ] Add screen reader optimizations
- [ ] Color contrast improvements

### ðŸ§ª Testing Strategy
- All critical flow tests are scaffolded but skipped
- Enable tests as features are implemented
- Use feature flags to A/B test performance improvements
- Monitor performance metrics before/after optimization

### ðŸ“Š Observability
- Structured logging is in place for:
  - Daily scan operations (`scan-logger.ts`)
  - Recommendation generation (`reco-logger.ts`)
  - General application flows (`structured-logs.ts`)
- Ready to monitor performance impact of optimizations

### ðŸš€ Rollout Plan
1. Implement features behind flags (default OFF)
2. Enable flags in development for testing
3. Gradual rollout in production with monitoring
4. Full rollout once performance gains confirmed

### ðŸ’¡ Implementation Notes
- All optimizations must maintain API compatibility
- Feature flags allow safe rollback if issues occur
- Comprehensive logging will help measure optimization impact
- Tests will verify both performance and functionality

**Ready for implementation when optimization work begins**
