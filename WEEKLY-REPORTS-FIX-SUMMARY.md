# Weekly Reports System - Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed ✅

### 1. Critical Issues

#### ✅ Authentication Inconsistency
**Problem**: Functions used different auth methods
- `weekly-report` expected `Bearer ${cronSecret}`
- `weekly-report-scheduler` expected `x-cron-secret` header

**Fix**: Both functions now use `x-cron-secret` header consistently

#### ✅ Week Calculation Discrepancy  
**Problem**: Each function had its own week calculation logic with subtle differences
- `weekly-report`: Used local `getLastCompleteWeek()` 
- `weekly-report-scheduler`: Had different calculation logic

**Fix**: Both now use shared `getLastCompleteWeekUTC()` from `supabase/functions/_shared/report/week.ts`

#### ✅ Duplicate Cron Jobs
**Problem**: Two cron jobs at same time (both Monday 8 AM UTC)
- `weekly-reports-pdf-csv`
- `weekly-csv-reports`

**Fix**: Consolidated into single `weekly-reports-unified` job (manual setup required - see WEEKLY-REPORTS-CRON-SETUP.md)

### 2. High Priority Issues

#### ✅ Missing Storage RLS Policies
**Problem**: Users couldn't download reports - no RLS policies on storage buckets

**Fix**: Added RLS policies for both buckets:
- `weekly-reports` bucket: Users can download their org's CSV reports
- `reports` bucket: Users can download their org's PDF reports

#### ✅ Placeholder PDF Generation
**Problem**: PDF generation was just text placeholder

**Fix**: Implemented proper PDF generation using pdf-lib:
- Professional formatting with fonts and layout
- Cover page with metrics
- Top performing prompts section
- Proper pagination

#### ✅ Missing Indexes
**Problem**: Report queries could be slow on large datasets

**Fix**: Added indexes:
- `idx_weekly_reports_org_week` on `weekly_reports(org_id, week_start_date)`
- `idx_reports_org_week` on `reports(org_id, week_key)`

### 3. Configuration Issues

#### ✅ CORS Headers  
**Problem**: Missing `x-cron-secret` in CORS headers

**Fix**: Added `x-cron-secret` to allowed headers in both functions

#### ✅ Monitoring Function
**Problem**: No easy way to check cron job status

**Fix**: Added `get_weekly_report_cron_status()` function

## Architecture Changes

### Before (Problematic)
```
Cron Job 1 → weekly-report (PDF) [Bearer auth]
Cron Job 2 → weekly-report-scheduler (CSV) [x-cron-secret]
                     ↓
         Different week calculations
         Different auth methods
         Race conditions
```

### After (Fixed)
```
Cron Job → weekly-report (PDF + CSV) [x-cron-secret]
              ↓
    Shared week utility
    Consistent auth
    Single source of truth
```

## Files Modified

### Edge Functions
1. ✅ `supabase/functions/weekly-report/index.ts`
   - Now uses shared week utility
   - Uses `x-cron-secret` auth
   - Implements proper PDF generation

2. ✅ `supabase/functions/weekly-report-scheduler/index.ts`
   - Now uses shared week utility  
   - Uses `x-cron-secret` auth

3. ℹ️ `supabase/functions/generate-weekly-report/index.ts`
   - **Deprecated** - redirects to main function
   - Can be removed in future cleanup

### Database
1. ✅ **Migration Applied**: Storage RLS policies + indexes
2. ⏸️ **Manual Setup Required**: Cron job configuration

### Documentation
1. ✅ `WEEKLY-REPORTS-CRON-SETUP.md` - Complete cron setup guide
2. ✅ `WEEKLY-REPORTS-FIX-SUMMARY.md` - This document
3. ℹ️ `WEEKLY-REPORTS-README.md` - Original documentation (still valid)
4. ℹ️ `README_REPORTS.md` - Feature documentation (still valid)

## Known Remaining Issues ⚠️

### Pre-existing Security Warnings
The migration revealed some pre-existing security warnings (not caused by this fix):
1. **Security Definer View** (ERROR)
2. **Function Search Path Mutable** (WARN x2) 
3. **Extension in Public** (WARN)

These are pre-existing issues that should be addressed separately.

## Next Steps for User 🚀

### Immediate (Required)

1. **Set up CRON_SECRET**
   ```sql
   -- Via SQL
   INSERT INTO app_settings (key, value, description)
   VALUES (
     'cron_secret',
     encode(gen_random_bytes(32), 'hex'),
     'Secret for authenticating cron job requests'
   );
   
   -- Get the secret value
   SELECT value FROM app_settings WHERE key = 'cron_secret';
   ```
   
   OR via [Supabase Dashboard > Edge Functions > Secrets](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/cgocsffxqyhojtyzniyz/settings/functions)

2. **Configure Cron Job**
   - Follow instructions in `WEEKLY-REPORTS-CRON-SETUP.md`
   - Delete old duplicate jobs
   - Create new `weekly-reports-unified` job
   - Test with manual trigger

3. **Verify Setup**
   ```sql
   -- Check cron job status
   SELECT * FROM get_weekly_report_cron_status();
   
   -- Test manual trigger
   SELECT net.http_post(
     url := 'https://cgocsffxqyhojtyzniyz.supabase.co/functions/v1/weekly-report',
     headers := '{"Content-Type": "application/json", "x-cron-secret": "YOUR_SECRET"}'::jsonb,
     body := '{"scheduled": true}'::jsonb
   );
   ```

### Optional (Recommended)

4. **Monitor First Run**
   - Wait for Monday 8 AM UTC or trigger manually
   - Check [Edge Function Logs](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/cgocsffxqyhojtyzniyz/functions/weekly-report/logs)
   - Verify reports appear in database:
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM weekly_reports ORDER BY generated_at DESC LIMIT 5;
     SELECT * FROM reports ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
     ```

5. **Test Report Download**
   - Log in as a user
   - Navigate to Reports page
   - Download a report
   - Verify PDF and CSV open correctly

6. **Clean Up**
   - Once confirmed working, can remove deprecated `generate-weekly-report` function
   - Review and address pre-existing security warnings

## Testing Checklist ✓

- [ ] CRON_SECRET is set in Supabase secrets or app_settings
- [ ] Old duplicate cron jobs are deleted
- [ ] New unified cron job is created
- [ ] Manual test of edge function succeeds
- [ ] Scheduler run logged in `scheduler_runs` table
- [ ] Reports generated for active orgs
- [ ] PDF report opens and displays correctly
- [ ] CSV report downloads and has data
- [ ] User can download their org's reports
- [ ] User cannot download other orgs' reports
- [ ] Cron job runs automatically on Monday

## Support

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check Edge Function Logs**: Look for `[WEEKLY-REPORT]` entries
2. **Check Scheduler Runs**: Query `scheduler_runs` table
3. **Verify Authentication**: Ensure CRON_SECRET matches
4. **Test Storage Access**: Check RLS policies allow download

## Success Criteria

The system is working correctly when:
1. ✅ Cron job runs every Monday at 8 AM UTC
2. ✅ Reports generated for all active organizations
3. ✅ Both PDF and CSV files created and stored
4. ✅ Users can download their organization's reports
5. ✅ No duplicate or failed report generations
6. ✅ Edge function logs show successful execution
