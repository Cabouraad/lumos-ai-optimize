# Security Enhancement Actions

## Overview
This document tracks security improvements made to address Supabase linter warnings and follow security best practices.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Extensions in Public Schema (WARN)
**Issue**: Extensions installed in the `public` schema pose security risks
**Reference**: https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/database-linter?lint=0014_extension_in_public

**Actions Taken**:
- ✅ Created `extensions` schema for proper extension isolation
- ✅ Migration added to move common extensions (`pg_stat_statements`, `uuid-ossp`, `pgcrypto`, `pgjwt`, `http`) out of public schema
- ⚠️ **Admin Action Required**: Verify in production that all extensions have been moved to `extensions` schema

**Verification Commands**:
```sql
-- Check which extensions are still in public schema
SELECT e.extname, n.nspname as schema_name 
FROM pg_extension e 
JOIN pg_namespace n ON e.extnamespace = n.oid 
WHERE n.nspname = 'public';

-- Should return no results if successful
```

### 2. Leaked Password Protection Disabled (WARN)
**Issue**: Password leak protection not enabled for enhanced security
**Reference**: https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/password-security#password-strength-and-leaked-password-protection

**Actions Required**:
- ⚠️ **Manual Dashboard Action Required**: 
  1. Go to Supabase Dashboard > Authentication > Settings
  2. Enable "Password strength validation"
  3. Enable "Leaked password protection"
  4. Save settings

**Note**: This cannot be enabled via SQL migration - requires dashboard configuration.

## Post-Migration Checklist

### Immediate Actions Required
- [ ] **Admin**: Verify extension migration in production using verification commands above
- [ ] **Admin**: Enable leaked password protection in Supabase Dashboard
- [ ] **Admin**: Re-run linter to confirm all issues resolved: `supabase db lint`

### Monitoring
- [ ] Monitor authentication logs for any issues after enabling password protection
- [ ] Verify extension functions still work correctly (uuid generation, crypto functions)
- [ ] Test user registration/login flows after password protection is enabled

## Security Impact

### Before
- Extensions in public schema could be accessed/modified by application users
- Weak/compromised passwords could be used for authentication

### After  
- Extensions isolated in dedicated schema with proper access controls
- Enhanced password validation prevents use of known compromised passwords
- Improved overall database security posture

## RLS Lockdown Implementation

### Prompts and Recommendations Security
- **Before**: prompts and recommendations tables were publicly readable
- **After**: Full RLS enforcement with org-based isolation  
- **Impact**: Anonymous users can no longer access business data; authenticated users only see rows for their own organization

### Subscribers Hardening  
- **Before**: Weak RLS policies on subscribers table
- **After**: Strict per-user isolation using auth.uid() + user_id relationship
- **Impact**: Enhanced data isolation while preserving existing UI functionality

### Implementation Details
- Added `get_current_org_id()` security definer function for clean org resolution
- Implemented comprehensive CRUD policies for prompts and recommendations
- Added performance indexes on org_id columns
- Server jobs remain unchanged and functional

### Testing
- Anonymous access tests verify 401/403 responses for business tables
- Org isolation tests confirm users only see their organization's data
- Existing functionality preserved for browser clients

## SQL Injection Protection

### Comprehensive Assessment Completed
- **Assessment Date**: 2025-01-27
- **Overall Risk**: LOW-MEDIUM
- **Status**: ✅ Strong baseline protection, improvements recommended

**Key Findings**:
- All database queries use Supabase JS client with parameterized queries (safe)
- No raw SQL string concatenation vulnerabilities found
- RLS policies provide defense-in-depth protection
- Input validation improvements needed for UUID and string inputs

**Documentation**: See `docs/security-sql-injection-assessment.md` for complete assessment

**Implementation Status**:
- ✅ Security assessment completed
- ✅ Validation library created (`supabase/functions/_shared/validation.ts`)
- ⚠️ **Pending**: Apply validation to critical edge functions
- ⚠️ **Pending**: Enable security tests in test suite

**Priority Actions Required**:
1. **High Priority**: Add UUID validation to edge functions (run-prompt-now, analyze-ai-response, etc.)
2. **High Priority**: Add input length limits to all string inputs
3. **Medium Priority**: Enable security tests in `src/__tests__/security/edge-function-auth.test.ts`
4. **Medium Priority**: Escape LIKE patterns in search operations

## Future Recommendations

1. **Regular Security Audits**: Run `supabase db lint` monthly to catch new security issues
2. **Input Validation Review**: Quarterly review of validation patterns across edge functions
3. **Security Testing**: Continuous monitoring of security test coverage
4. **Password Policy Review**: Consider additional password complexity requirements
5. **Extension Management**: Review and audit all database extensions quarterly
6. **Access Control**: Regularly review RLS policies and user permissions

## Emergency Rollback (If Needed)

If extension migration causes issues:
```sql
-- Emergency rollback - move extensions back to public (NOT RECOMMENDED)
ALTER EXTENSION [extension_name] SET SCHEMA public;
```

**Important**: Only perform rollback if critical functionality is broken. Address root cause instead.
