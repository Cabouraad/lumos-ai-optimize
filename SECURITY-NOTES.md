# Security Enhancement Actions

## Overview
This document tracks security improvements made to address Supabase linter warnings and follow security best practices.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Extensions in Public Schema (WARN)
**Issue**: Extensions installed in the `public` schema pose security risks
**Reference**: https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/database-linter?lint=0014_extension_in_public

**Actions Taken**:
- ✅ Created `extensions` schema for proper extension isolation
- ✅ Migration added to move common extensions (`pg_stat_statements`, `uuid-ossp`, `pgcrypto`, `pgjwt`, `http`) out of public schema
- ⚠️ **Admin Action Required**: Verify in production that all extensions have been moved to `extensions` schema

**Verification Commands**:
```sql
-- Check which extensions are still in public schema
SELECT e.extname, n.nspname as schema_name 
FROM pg_extension e 
JOIN pg_namespace n ON e.extnamespace = n.oid 
WHERE n.nspname = 'public';

-- Should return no results if successful
```

### 2. Leaked Password Protection Disabled (WARN)
**Issue**: Password leak protection not enabled for enhanced security
**Reference**: https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/password-security#password-strength-and-leaked-password-protection

**Actions Required**:
- ⚠️ **Manual Dashboard Action Required**: 
  1. Go to Supabase Dashboard > Authentication > Settings
  2. Enable "Password strength validation"
  3. Enable "Leaked password protection"
  4. Save settings

**Note**: This cannot be enabled via SQL migration - requires dashboard configuration.

## Post-Migration Checklist

### Immediate Actions Required
- [ ] **Admin**: Verify extension migration in production using verification commands above
- [ ] **Admin**: Enable leaked password protection in Supabase Dashboard
- [ ] **Admin**: Re-run linter to confirm all issues resolved: `supabase db lint`

### Monitoring
- [ ] Monitor authentication logs for any issues after enabling password protection
- [ ] Verify extension functions still work correctly (uuid generation, crypto functions)
- [ ] Test user registration/login flows after password protection is enabled

## Security Impact

### Before
- Extensions in public schema could be accessed/modified by application users
- Weak/compromised passwords could be used for authentication

### After  
- Extensions isolated in dedicated schema with proper access controls
- Enhanced password validation prevents use of known compromised passwords
- Improved overall database security posture

## Future Recommendations

1. **Regular Security Audits**: Run `supabase db lint` monthly to catch new security issues
2. **Password Policy Review**: Consider additional password complexity requirements
3. **Extension Management**: Review and audit all database extensions quarterly
4. **Access Control**: Regularly review RLS policies and user permissions

## Emergency Rollback (If Needed)

If extension migration causes issues:
```sql
-- Emergency rollback - move extensions back to public (NOT RECOMMENDED)
ALTER EXTENSION [extension_name] SET SCHEMA public;
```

**Important**: Only perform rollback if critical functionality is broken. Address root cause instead.
