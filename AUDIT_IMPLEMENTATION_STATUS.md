# Enhanced Audit Implementation Plan

## Security & Configuration ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Edge function JWT verification enabled for sensitive operations
- [x] Auth helper functions created for proper org ID derivation
- [x] Test API key flow fixed to accept user-provided keys
- [x] Database indexes added for performance
- [x] Unified scoring system (0-10 scale) with conversion helpers

## Core Function Fixes ✅ COMPLETED  
- [x] Fixed `test-prompt-response` undefined variable bug
- [x] Updated `run-prompt-now` to use authenticated user's org
- [x] Fixed `daily-scheduler` function call parameters
- [x] Updated `advanced-recommendations` to use proper auth
- [x] Citations extraction and persistence in shared modules

## Data Model & Consistency ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Scoring standardized to 0-10 internal, 0-100 UI display
- [x] Score conversion functions created and applied
- [x] Dashboard data fetching updated for consistent scoring
- [x] Recommendation thresholds updated to use score constants

## UI & UX Improvements ✅ IN PROGRESS
- [x] Auth cleanup utilities created
- [x] Competitors page data integration started
- [x] Dashboard provider health display updated
- [ ] Prompts page real data integration
- [ ] Empty states and error handling
- [ ] Unit tests for core functions

## Documentation Updates
- [ ] Update SCHEDULER_SETUP.md with correct function and auth
- [ ] Document scoring scale and conversion
- [ ] API documentation for edge functions

## Next Steps
1. Complete Prompts page data integration
2. Add comprehensive error handling and empty states
3. Create unit tests for provider extraction and scoring
4. Update documentation
5. Final security and performance review

## Security Warnings Noted
The migration completed with 3 general configuration warnings (not blocking):
- Extension in public schema (common with uuid-ossp)
- Auth OTP expiry settings 
- Leaked password protection settings

These are configuration recommendations, not critical security flaws.
