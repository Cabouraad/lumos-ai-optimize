## Security & Enforcement

All tier limits are enforced at multiple levels:

1. **Frontend**: `useSubscriptionGate` hook controls UI access
2. **Backend**: Edge functions validate quotas before execution
3. **Database**: RLS policies restrict data access by subscription
4. **Daily Limits**: Usage tracking in `daily_usage` table

## Testing Recommendations

Run these tests before public launch:

```bash
# Test quota enforcement
npm test src/__tests__/critical-flows/quota-limits-boundary.test.ts

# Test subscription gating
npm test src/__tests__/subscription-gating-matrix.test.tsx

# Test billing enforcement
npm test src/__tests__/critical-flows/billing-enforcement.test.ts
```

## Notes

- All quotas reset daily at midnight UTC
- Trial period is 7 days for Starter tier only
- Payment method must be collected during trial
- Bypass users are locked to Starter entitlements
- "Scale" tier has been removed and replaced with "Growth"
